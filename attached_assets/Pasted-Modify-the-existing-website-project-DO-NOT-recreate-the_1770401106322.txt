Modify the existing website project — DO NOT recreate the project and DO NOT delete existing content unless necessary.

Improve and refactor the current code so it becomes production-ready, mobile-first, and deployable on GitHub Pages and Netlify.

Keep the existing design and structure but enhance responsiveness, reliability, and polish.

1. Mobile-First Optimization (Top Priority)

Convert the entire layout to mobile-first CSS.

Rules:

Base styles must target screens under 480px first

Use media queries only for tablets and desktops (min-width)

Remove horizontal scrolling everywhere

All cards stack vertically on mobile

Minimum tap target size: 48px height

Buttons full width on phones

Navbar becomes hamburger menu under 768px

Sticky bottom "Call / Book" bar for mobile users

Fix spacing issues:

Consistent padding system (16px / 24px / 32px scale)

Prevent text overflow

Ensure pricing cards don't overflow screen

2. Booking Section Reliability Fix

Ensure ALL:
Book Now
Get Quote
Plan Buttons
Call Now buttons

scroll smoothly to:
#book-now

Never open dialer directly except inside the booking cards.

Fix scrolling using:
scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" })

3. Copy Number System (Make Robust)

Improve clipboard feature:

Requirements:

Works on mobile and desktop

Icon 📋 changes to ✔ for 1.5s

Add fallback if clipboard permission denied

Add toast notification "Number Copied"

Double click number → copy (desktop)
Tap call button → call (mobile)

4. Hosting Compatibility (Important)

Prepare project for GitHub Pages & Netlify:

Remove absolute paths

Use relative paths only

No localhost references

No server dependencies

No unused files

Add proper favicon reference

Add meta viewport tag

Add SEO meta description

Make sure site works when opened directly as index.html

5. Performance Cleanup

Optimize:

Remove duplicate CSS

Merge repetitive classes

Minimize JavaScript usage

Avoid inline styles

Lazy load images

Reduce animation lag on mobile

6. Subtle Gold Luxury Accents (Visual Upgrade)

Add VERY subtle metallic gold accents:

Where to apply:

Thin separators between sections

Hover shimmer on buttons

Card border highlight on hover

Underline animation in navbar

Gold must look metallic:
Use gradient gold, not yellow
Low opacity only
No glowing neon gold

Example feel: luxury car badge reflection

7. Code Maintainability

Refactor code to be clean:

Organize CSS sections (navbar, hero, services, pricing, booking, footer)

Group JS functions

Add clear comments

Keep files limited to:
index.html
style.css
script.js

8. Final Verification

Ensure:

Works perfectly on phone first

Smooth scrolling works

Copy button works everywhere

All buttons functional

No console errors

Ready for direct deployment

Do NOT redesign the site — only improve and polish.
